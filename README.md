# Coffee_Data_Analytics
Analytics for Coffee Data from Coffee Quality Institute

# Data
These data contain reviews of 1311 arabica and 28 robusta coffee beans from the Coffee Quality Institute's trained reviewers.
Coffee Quality Institute (CQI): https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/

These datasets are gathered from Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) in January, 2018.
I'm not the Owner of the Datasets, nor scrapping was performed by me. It was done in this GitHub's repo (kudos for the author, https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database), see there for further details.

I gathered data from Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) again in May, 2022. (There are 209 new rows of coffee beans data) Then, I concatenated and clean two data for following analyzing.
